## Problem it Solves

- It gives curated list of destinations based on rating where LGBTQ+ communites are welcomed.
- It is important to ensure safety and the locations recommended here are safe.
- It helps to be a part of greater facilitator in travel and tourism needs of LGBTQ+ communities.

## Challenges we faced

- Gathering the data of categories as such hotels, restaurants, dineouts, beachers, etc.
- Building the database for co-ordinates(latitude and Longitude) of the places.
- Fetching reviews and ratings.
- Plaing the searching parameters.
- integrating multiple 3rd party services like maps, booking sites was the trickiest part.

## Proposed Enhancements
- Scrapping data of hotels.
- integrating ride booking.
- Live in-app events.
- Support for connecting chain on institutions.
